# Practice-DSA

DSA questions and theory I learnt from Internshala course. 
This helped me understand the data structures and how the system works internally, as working with C, especially after working in cpp, made me realise the lack of functions and how i need to manually write my own functions to do simple tasks. 
This helped understand how space is optimized to a fair degree. 
I am glad I took the opportunity to find and complete this course.

Here, you'll find all the programs I worked on, from basic to advanced.
